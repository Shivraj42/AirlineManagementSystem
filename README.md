The Airline Management System is a comprehensive software solution for airline administrators to efficiently manage customer management, flight management, and ticket booking processes.  The system allows administrators to add and search customers, add flights, book flights, generate tickets, and manage administrators securely.
Title: Airline Management System

Overview:
The Airline Management System is a comprehensive software solution developed using Java as the backend language, along with Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), and MySQL as the database management system. It aims to facilitate various operations of an airline, including customer management, flight management, and ticket booking. The system allows functionalities such as adding customers, searching customers, adding flights, booking flights, generating tickets, and managing administrators.

Technologies Used:

Backend Language: Java
GUI Framework: Java Swing
Database Management System: MySQL
MySQL Connector: MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver)

Key Features:

Customer Management:

Add Customer: Enables the addition of customer details such as name, contact information, and frequent flyer information.
Search Customer: Allows users to search and retrieve customer details based on specified criteria.
